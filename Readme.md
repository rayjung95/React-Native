# Rendevous
This app was built using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

Rendevous is a social networking mobile app for swiping on parties and events near you. Rendevous solves that problem of loneliness by giving people parties and events they can be personally confirmed to. Rendevous is also used to host parties and events. Hosts are given full control of who becomes a confirmed guest, making the events manageable, in the size and diversity you wish for. Therefore, there is a level of safety and protection through the required Facebook log in and keeping event details locked until guests are confirmed by the host. The host is in total control of whomever he or she decides to engage with.

## Getting Started

To test the app, we use expo.

You'll need to have Node.js (version 6 or newer) installed on your computer. [Download the latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You can install Expo CLI by running:

`npm install -g expo-cli`

### On your device

[Download for Android from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)  or  [for iOS from the App Store](https://itunes.com/apps/exponent)

> **Required Android and iOS versions:**  The minimum Android version Expo supports is Android 4.4 and the minimum iOS version is iOS 9.0.
>

### 

Android emulator

Follow our  [Android Studio emulator guide](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator.html)  to set up Android tools and create a virtual device. Start up the virtual device when it's ready.

Once the emulator is open and you have a project open in Expo Dev Tools, you can press  _Run on Android device/emulator_  in Expo Dev Tools and it will install the Expo client to the emulator and open up your app inside of it.

### Watchman

Some macOS users encounter issues if they do not have this installed on their machine, so we recommend that you install Watchman. Watchman watches files and records when they change, then triggers actions in response to this, and it's used internally by React Native.  [Download and install Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).
